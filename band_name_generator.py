#First is a simple greeting message.
print("Hello!! Welcome to Band Name Generator!!!")
# We define two variable and ask the user using the 'input' function.
city = input("What is the name of your city? ")
pet = input("What is the name of your city? ")
# Once the user has provided the inputs, we concatinate the variables together and print it alltogether.
print("The Name of your Band is: " + city + " " + pet)
#Thank You!!!
